# Goal
The goal of this project is to introduce myself into networking and prepare myself for the networking class that im going to take next semester. Specifically, this project focuses on using Python's socket import to utilize sockets to scan for open port numbers given a host (IP address or domain name). 

## Input Validation
I implemented extensive input validation at the start of this project to maintain security best practices, and although I might change how this program is implemented (as just a script, GUI, or web application), I can use these solid building blocks to adjust for these different implementations.

## Future of the project
I want to keep this project relatively short because I want to also get hands on experience with other cybersecurity related topics like: SIEM, Firewalls, Virtual Machines, User and Role management ... 

Here are some features that I plan on adding and will check off as I continue with this project:

* Service detection (banner grabbing)
* Implement different scan types (SYN scan, stealth scan)
* JSON report generation
* Scan multiple hosts
* Add IDS evasion techniques
* Recon features like Geolocation or WHOIS lookup

Here are some other features that I think would be cool but probably wont implement in full:

* Live progress bar
* Database history logging
* Threading/Concurrency
